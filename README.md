260 class final project, predicting dental care utilization

## Introduction 

  One in every five children experience special healthcare needs in the United States (Williams 2021). Special healthcare needs are defined as “physical, intellectual, and developmental disabilities, as well as long-standing medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, a blood disorder, or muscular dystrophy” (CDC 2021). 

  Previous studies reported that children with special healthcare needs (CSHCN) experience a higher burden of oral health problems compared to those who are not CSHCN (Lebrun-Harris 2021). CSHCN are at a higher risk for dental trauma injuries due to increased fall risk and dental anomalies such as supernumerary teeth (Devinsky 2020). Medications prescribed to treat conditions among CSHCN, such as seizure disorders, lead to oral conditions including xerostomia and gingival hyperplasia (Devinsky 2020). Sociobehaviorally, CSHCN may be more prone to a cariogenic diet due to a higher consumption of sugary foods, further raising the risks of dental caries (Devinsky 2020).
  
  The high caries risk among CSHCN may also be attributed to challenges with home care, specifically oral hygiene maintenance. For example, a survey on pre-school aged CSHCN found that four out of five CSHCN parents reported difficulties with brushing their children’s teeth (Huebner 2015). 
Limitations in dental services available to CSHCN is also a major barrier to consider. In the United States, there is a national shortage of dentists and healthcare institutions equipped to provide dental services for CSHCN (Kerins 2020). Reasons why CSHCN families struggle to find dental care include dentists refusing to accept Medicaid or treat patients who are CSHCN (Kagihara 2011). Within dental education, the current training for dental professionals in caring for CSHCN is highly limited--major inconsistencies exist across dental education institutions in both pre-doctoral and residency training (Inclan 2019) (Baker 2017).
	
	Socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities have also been found to exist among CSHCN families. CSHCN who are Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, or from families of lower socioeconomic status, have a higher prevalence of unmet dental needs. Recent national data shows that Medicaid/CHIP covers approximately one-half of all CSHCN children, the remaining half is covered by private insurance (Williams 2021). Families of CSHCN who experience higher out-of-pocket costs are associated with higher unmet dental needs among their CSHCN.
Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic poses additional challenges to dental care access for children in general, due to the limitations in availability of dental clinics and delayed care to minimize risks of COVID-19 infections from dental visits (Ritwik 2021). 

  This study will examine the oral health care utilization among adolescents in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Acknowledging the unique, multifaceted factors that contribute to the oral health experience of CSHCN, the study will incorporate the sociodemographic backgrounds of children and their families.
